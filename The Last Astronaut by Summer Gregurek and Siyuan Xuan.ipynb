    "Summer Gregurek and Siyuan Xuan's Project: The Last Astronaut, a Pygame\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code is a platformer game similar to the original Marios Brothers game and loosely based off of a game that was written in C for EE 319K. The Last Astronaut started as a project to learn how to translate C into Python using existing libraries and tools, and evolved into a unique Python game that runs in simulation on the computer. The entirety of its code is included below, including both classes that make up the game play functionality as it sits, and classes that we programmed to learn more about the Pygame library but did not make it into the final version of the game. The game will not run in the Jupyter notebook, as it needs dependency image files for the sprites, so the whole game folder that will run will be turned in on Canvas with this notebook. We will also include a link to our GitHub, so that the evolution of this game can be seen as it was being programmed. The original C source code is also staged on the GitHub under the folder \"Lab 10\". Additionally, we will provide a link to YouTube video that shows demonstration of the original puzzle platformer in C so that the evolution of the game from a puzzle with stationary obstacles to a Mario-esque platformer with a moving alien enemy can be seen. Finally, we will provide links to the forum with the walkthrough that gave us ideas for much of the structure of the game itself, as it was noted on Canvas to \"Please include your resources (It is ok if you found a solution for your problem on the web, I consider this to be clever.)\" Although we used this walkthrough as a starting point for our game, we changed a lot about how the platforms themselves work, and we used original graphics created by us. We also included a starting and ending screen to our game, and changed spawn mechanics, character speed, and how levels work within the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "The game is played by using the arrow keys to move the astronaut left and right and using the spacebar to jump. The astronaut can collide with the platforms in the game, the coins, and the enemy space alien. The astronaut must collect ten coins to win the game before he is killed five times by the alien. The alien moves randomly at a speed that varies and if it touches the player, both the player and alien will respawn at their respective starting points and the player will lose a life. The loss of life will be reflected by the status icons in the top left corner of the screen. If the alien touches a coin, the coin will move positions randomly. If the player touches a coin, the player collects it and it will be shown in inventory in the top right corner. Whenever the player collects all the coins and wins, a winning screen will show and prompt the player to restart or quit by clicking a button with the mouse. Likewise, whenever the player dies five times to the space alien, a losing screen will show and also prompt the player to restart or quit.\n",

Since we decided to change how levels worked, and since the game was challenging enough without the added spikes, these classes were not implemented in the final game class, but were left in the final code as they were good practice in translating concepts from the C iteration of the game to its Python counterpart. These classes, like most other graphics classes, have a surface that defines how the objects look, and a rect that defines how the objects behave."

    "The Player class defines information about The Last Astronaut himself, or the player character. The astronaut is initialized as being stationary and in the bottom left corner of the screen, as he was in the original game. The event function allows the astronaut to jump pretty high pretty quickly, with a speed of -22, to simulate low gravity. This ability to jump is different from the original game where the astronaut could not jump and was at the whim of gravity itself. The event function also allows for left and right movement and for detection of the ground beneath the astronaut. This is important to determine if the astronaut has collided with a platform (further defined by the on_ground function) and to determine if the astronaut can jump (i.e. he can jump off of the ground, but cannot jump while already in midair.) Finally, the draw function draws the surface and rect of the astronaut to the screen using the included image files for him, which works similar to other graphics in the game."

    "The above enemy class is similar to the player class in its draw and on_ground functions for collision detection with the ground and graphics display, but is different in how it is initialized, moves, and how it does collision with objects. The alien is initialized with a random x speed between 3 and 7, meaning it could be potentially faster or slower than the player, whose speed is set at 5. The alien also spawns in a different place, and has seemingly random movements coded in to make it difficult for the player to avoid him. The alien will turn if it hits a wall and continue moving left and right, and cannot jump. If it collides with a player, as long as the player is not at the starting position (as to prevent spawn kills) the player will lose a life and the alien will reset. Finally, the alien's speed is randomly determined on reset as well, not just when it spawns. The alien cannot be killed, only avoided, and it can move coins by touching them, as we will further see in the coin class below."

Since we were very new to Python before beginning this class, this walkthrough was the basis for this game, but our final product is a lot different from this exact walkthrough: part 1 https://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/400812-walk-through-a-platform-game-made-with-pygame-part-%231/#1/ and part 2 https://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/400880-walk-through-a-platform-game-made-with-pygame-part-%232/#2/ Our functioning code in a folder with all image dependencies as well as screenshots of the game working will be uploaded to Canvas with this notebook. Please open the entire folder in Spyder and run the file final_project.py to play our Pygame!"
